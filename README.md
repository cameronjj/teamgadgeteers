Accessible Maker Kit

## Description
We aim to make Physical Computing accessible for the visually impaired, thus providing a further creative outlet and hands-on STEM education resource.  Our current goal is to make an interactive online tutorial with puzzles which has English alphabets etched onto it and also make a storyboard with different puzzle pieces.
